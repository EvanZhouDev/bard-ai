An easy way to continue a chat with Bard.

## Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers {5-7}
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

let myChat = myBard.createChat({ ...ids });
console.log(await myChat.ask("How are you?"));
console.log(await myChat.ask("What's the last thing I said?"));
```

## Arguments

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ids`     | object | Used for [importing](/advanced/importExportChat) a previous conversation. If left blank, creates a new conversation. |

## Usage

Create a new conversation with the following code:

```javascript copy
let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

let myChat = myBard.createChat();
```

### `Chat.ask()`

Asks something to the current `Chat()` instance.

#### Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

let myChat = myBard.createChat({ ...ids });
console.log(await myChat.ask("What is 1+1?"));
console.log(await myChat.ask("What is 1 more than that value?"));
```

#### Usage

Call the `.ask()` method asynchronously (with an `await`) on the same instance of `Bard.Chat`. That way, it will remember what was previously said. This is similar to continuing a "Chat" in ChatGPT.

<Callout type="info">
  The `Chat.ask()` method has the exact same API as `Bard.ask()` (in fact, they
  call the same function under the hood). This means that it also supports the
  same config. Check the [documentation for `Bard.ask()`](/basics/ask) for more
  information.

### `Chat.export()`

Exports the current conversation. Go to [Importing/Exporting Chats](/advanced/importExportChat) to learn more.
