To get your first AI output from Bard, copy and paste the following code into your IDE of choice:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE)

console.log(await myBard.ask("Hello world!"));
```

Let's walk through what this code is doing:
<Steps>
### Import
```javascript copy
import Bard from "bard-ai";
```
Everything in `bard-ai` is compressed into a singular `Bard` class, and thus `Bard` is the only thing you need to import.

### Authenticate
```javascript copy
let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);
```

Next, we need to initialize `bard-ai`. Create a new `Bard` instance, and pass in your `COOKIE`.

### Ask Bard!
```javascript copy
console.log(await myBard.ask("Hello world!"));
```
Finally, we use the `ask` method on `Bard` to query Google Bard. This is `async`, so ensure you use `await`.

</Steps>
