# `bard-ai` Quick Start

Use this page to just get a glimpse of the power of `bard-ai`. Make sure you read through the next few pages for a more comprehensive tutorial.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you read through the [Authentication](/prerequisites/authentication)
  page first, if you haven't already.

To get your first AI output from Bard, copy and paste the following code into your IDE of choice:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

console.log(await myBard.ask("Hello world!"));
```

Let's walk through what this code is doing:

<Steps>
### Import
```javascript copy
import Bard from "bard-ai";
```
Everything in `bard-ai` is compressed into a singular `Bard` class, and thus `Bard` is the only thing you need to import.

### Authenticate

```javascript copy
let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);
```

Next, we need to initialize `bard-ai`. Create a new `Bard` instance, and pass in your [`COOKIE`](/prerequisites/authentication/#step-4).

### Ask Bard!

```javascript copy
console.log(await myBard.ask("Hello world!"));
```

Finally, we use the `ask` method on `Bard` to query Google Bard. This method is `async`, so ensure you use `await`.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You've made your first request with Bard. Read on for more detailed documentation, including how to use Chats, export conversations, and use Google Lens.
