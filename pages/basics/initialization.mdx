# Initialization of `bard-ai`

<Callout type="info">
	Make sure you read through the [Authentication](/prerequisites/authentication)
	page first, if you haven't already.
</Callout>

After obtaining your key, you are going to have to initialize it, so that `bard-ai` knows it. You key remains local on your device, so no one else can see it.

## Example

```javascript copy showLineNumbers {3}
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`     | string | The `COOKIE` you are initializing with. Required. |
| `config`  | object | Some advanced options you can pass in.            |

## Usage

Simply create a new instance of `Bard`, and pass in your `COOKIE`.

<Callout type="warning">
	It is recommended to store the key in a secure location (`.env`, for example),
	and then access it in your file indirectly. This will limit accidently
	committing or sending your key to GitHub or other platforms.
</Callout>

## Using a Different Cookie

`bard-ai` v2 comes with the ability to use cookies from different Google users. These will take the form of a `__Secure-#PSID` with a non-one number. If you wish to use such a cookie, simply prefix your `COOKIE` with `__Secure-#PSID=` (with your number), like this.

```javascript
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard("__Secure-3PSID=MY_COOKIE");
```

## Config

Pass in a configuration JSON, like this:

```javascript
let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE, {
	verbose: true,
	fetch: fetch,
	context: "Answer this like a pirate: "
});
```

| Config Option | Type     | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verbose`     | boolean  | Log information about what is happening                                |
| `fetch`       | function | Any fetch polyfill. Ensure it has the same interface as browser fetch. |
| `context`     | string   | Instructions prefixed before every request.                            |
