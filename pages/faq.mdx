# Frequently Asked Questions

Here's a list of commonly asked questions. If you have something that you feel like should be added here, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/bard-ai).

### Can't use Bard

The first thing to ensure is that (if you are only providing the Cookie value), that you are using the [correct cookie](/prerequisites/authentication/#step-4).

If that's all correct, go to [bard.google.com](bard.google.com), reset all your Cookies (not just your cache), and log in again to your Google account. Finally, get your new PSID.

If that _still_ doesn't work, then submit an issue [here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/bard-ai/issues).

### Can't `require` a ES6 module

`bard-ai` is now a strictly ES6 only module. This means that it only works with the `import` syntax. You can choose to migrate to ESM yourself (recommended), or alternatively use [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) if you still want to remain in CommonJS.

### `fetch` is undefined

The `fetch` function is still experimental (though enabled by default) in Node. Learn about polyfilling fetch, easier than ever in v2, [here](/recipes/fetch).

### Why doesn't bard-ai have streaming support

Users of `googlebard` may be looking for response streaming support in `bard-ai`. This isn't supported because Bard itself doesn't actually do response streaming. Googlebard implements this feature by [faking it](https://github.com/PawanOsman/GoogleBard/blob/cf6058e424ff6666065463fe73bbb9d84614a867/src/classes/bard.ts#L192).

If you really want that typing effect, you can also [make it in `bard-ai`](/recipes/streaming).
