### Can't use Bard

The first thing to ensure is that (if you are only providing the Cookie value), that you are using the Cookie exactly named `__Secure-1PSID`, and that you copy and pasted it correctly. If you are using another account's Cookie, ensure you are prefixing it with `__Secure-#PSID=` (with the equal mark, and your account number.)

If that's all correct, go to [bard.google.com](bard.google.com), reset all your Cookies (not just your cache), and log in again to your Google account. Finally, get your new PSID.

If that *still* doesn't work, then submit an issue [here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/bard-ai/issues).
