# Frequently Asked Questions

Here's a list of commonly asked questions. If you have something that you feel like should be added here, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/bard-ai).

### Can't use Bard

The first thing to ensure is that (if you are only providing the Cookie value), that you are using the [correct cookie](/prerequisites/authentication/#step-4).

If that's all correct, go to [bard.google.com](bard.google.com), reset all your Cookies (not just your cache), and log in again to your Google account. Finally, get your new PSID.

If that _still_ doesn't work, then submit an issue [here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/bard-ai/issues).

### Can't `require` a ES6 module

`bard-ai` is now a strictly ES6 only module. This means that it only works with the `import` syntax. You can choose to migrate to ESM yourself (recommended), or alternatively use [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) if you still want to remain in CommonJS.

For example:

```js
import("bard-ai").then(async ({ default: Bard }) => {
  const myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);
  console.log(await myBard.ask("Hello, world!"));
});
```

### `fetch` is undefined

The `fetch` function is still experimental (though enabled by default) in Node. Learn about polyfilling fetch, easier than ever in v2, [here](/fetch).
