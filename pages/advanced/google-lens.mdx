# Using Google Lens

With `bard-ai` v2, you now have access to a powerful AI image system, Google Lens. Pass in images to [`Bard.ask()`](/basics/ask) or [`Chat.ask()`](/basics/chat#chatask), and Bard will be able to process them.

Images can be a `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, or `webp`.

You can pass in the image as a `Buffer` or as a path, in the `image` option in `config`. Here's an example...

### Path

```javascript
import Bard from "bard-ai";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

console.log(
  await myBard.ask("What city is this?", {
    image: "./city_image.png",
  })
);
```

### Buffer

```javascript
import Bard from "bard-ai";
import fs from "fs";

let cityImage = fs.readFileSync("./city_image.png");

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE);

console.log(
  await myBard.ask("What city is this?", {
    image: cityImage,
  })
);
```

Compounded with the fact that you can get image output, Google Lens is a powerful feature.
