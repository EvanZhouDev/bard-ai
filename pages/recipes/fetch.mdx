# No `fetch`? No problem.

`bard-ai` uses Node's experimental `fetch` function, which is enabled by default now. However, if the environment you are in still doesn't support it, `bard-ai` v2 comes with a super easy way to polyfill!

<Steps>
### Step 1
Install `node-fetch` (or any other polyfill):

```bash copy
npm install node-fetch
```

### Step 2

Create a new Bard instance with that polyfill

```javascript copy
import fetch from "node-fetch";

let myBard = new Bard(COOKIE, {
    fetch: fetch
})
```

### Step 3

Use as normal!
