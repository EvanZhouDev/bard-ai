# Authentication

`bard-ai` works by simulating a user logging onto Bard, and calling a request. Because of this, `bard-ai` needs a specific cookie on Bard's website to be used.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Visit https://bard.google.com/, and sign into your Google account.

### Step 2

Open the Web Inspector, and go to the `Application` tab.

### Step 3

Spin open the `Cookies` dropdown, and click the option with `https://bard.google.com`.

### Step 4

Look for the Cookie labeled `__Secure-1PSID` **_exactly_**, and copy it. Now, use this cookie whenever `COOKIE` is referred to in the documentation.

You can also choose to [use multiple different cookies](/basics/initialization#using-a-different-cookie).

<Callout type="warning">
  Even though there does not seem to be a direct way to exploit your `COOKIE`,
  it is not a good idea to publicly share it anyway. Try to keep it as private
  as you can.
