# Authentication
`bard-ai` works by simulating a user logging onto Bard, and calling a request. Because of this, `bard-ai` needs a specific cookie on Bard's websie to be used.

<Steps>
 
### Step 1
 
Visit https://bard.google.com/, and sign into your Google account.
 
### Step 2
 
Open the Web Inspector, and go to the `Application` tab.

### Step 3
 
Spin open the `Cookies` dropdown, and click the option with `https://bard.google.com`.

### Step 4

Look for the Cookie labeled `__Secure-1PSID` **_exactly_**, and copy it. Now, use this cookie whenever `COOKIE` is referred to in the documentation.

You can also choose to [use a Cookie for a different account](/basics/initialization#using-a-different-cookie).

<Callout type="warning">
  Even though there does not seem to be a direct way to exploit your `COOKIE`, it is not a good idea to publically share it anyway. Try to keep it as private as you can.
